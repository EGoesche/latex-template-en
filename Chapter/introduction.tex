of a typeface, its impression, how harmonious the figures are in relation to each other
and check how wide or narrow it is. A dummy text should contain as many different 
letters as possible and be set in the original language. It does not have to
It does not have to make sense, but it should be readable. Foreign-language texts such as ``Lorem ipsum'' do not serve the purpose 
the actual purpose, as they give a false impression.


Figure~\ref{fig:mri} shows an example of MR images. There is much literature on the normalisation
